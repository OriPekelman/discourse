# Running Discourse on Platform.sh

Clone this repo and push to platform.sh. Tada.

Because we are not working on master in order to push this to platform.sh git server you can use:

```git push platform platform_sh:master```

Or merge the changes to your master branch.

To finish off the installation  you should set the hostname and the developer emails
```
platform vset -emaster env:DISCOURSE_HOSTNAME myhostnoame.com
platform vset -emaster env:DISCOURSE_DEVELOPER_EMAILS myemail@example.com
```

Most everything has been tested to be working but I will be happy to get feedback. Until we get NFS mounts for workers putting worker in main container

## Changes to upstream
Changes we have made to the default upstream repo:

add 
```
gem 'platform_sh_rails'
```

to the Gemfile. I manually edited the `Gemfile.lock` because currently running `bundle update` breaks the installation.

add 
````
require 'platform_sh_rails'
````
to `application.rb`

create `config/discourse.conf` and remove it from `.gitignore`

Add `.platform.app.yaml` and `.platform/routes.yaml` and  `.platform/services.yaml`

Created `Procfile_platform_sh`

## On first run
`platform ssh` and `bundle exec rake admin:create`
